Make shield look more shieldy

Level Editor
	- When in block mode, preview the currently selected tile at the mouse position.
	- A help screen when the user holds F1.
		-Might be a good idea to do this for the actual game too.

Fog of war mode -- Can only see enemy units if you can actually see them.
**MAYBE**An AI type that automatically searches 'hot spots', defined in the level file.  They'll walk around to different ones and see what they can find.
**MAYBE**When the enemy is finished 'investigating', it should run back to a guard room to alert a bunch of the 'hot spot' guards.
**MAYBE**Hoffman encode the level files

When investigating a square that the player has run away from, move one extra square so that you aren't half-staring at a corner when trying to find the player...

Make a way to select 'no unit' when selecting your controlled unit.
Make it so that the 'spawners' aren't tiles.

An Enemy spawner -- something that will create enemy units every once in a while.

Scrolling camera
	- Make stuff not draw itself if it is off camera.

Cache commonly used A* paths (eg. patrol paths)
When a unit dies on a trap panel square, alert the trap that the unit has died on it.
Traps
	Boulder Trap (Think dungeon keeper)
	Arrow slits (Can be shot through one-way)
	Dart trap (Shoots straight ahead)
	Moving Floors
Switches
	Anyone can step on it
	One you have to shoot / attack / break

A square that can be shot through, but not moved through.

After 3 alerts, the enemy should be permanantly alerted.
Have enemies investigate noises they hear but can't see. (If it isn't too slow.)

A Win Condition
Need a way to communicate objectives in the level definition.
Win Conditions:
	Kill target(s)
	Get to point
	Get treasure!

Units:
Civilian -- All enemy units always attack civilians first.
Knight -- Swordsman with more health but much slower movement
Juggernaut -- Good health, can't attack, slow move, takes extra damage when attacked from behind.
Thief -- Enemy cannot hear you.  Only has melee attack.
Assasin -- Enemy cannot hear you.  Has short ranged attack.
Barbarian -- High speed, melee only, low health.


Tilesets:
A guard post indicator.

--BRAINSTORMED STUFF--
Lighting and stealth based on it
Slow down a unit based on damage taken?
Enemies
	Sentry Enemy unit.
	Enemy that teleports (and a way to screw with that teleportation)
	Enemy that comes back to life
Potential Puzzle idea:  Button puzzle
Teleportation Squares
Potential Weapons that don't have a unit to go with them yet:
	Explosive that can destroy walls
	Disguise -- 
	Flashbang -- Alerts them to a point and deafens them if they're too close
	Hypnotist -- Target unit stops attacking and will not attack or move for a short while.
	Ghost or something.  Sacrifices itself to possess a unit.
	Cultist or something along those lines.  Melee only, enemies attack only it, and when it kills an enemy unit it transforms into something better.

---DONE---
When an enemy is alerted, they should alert all nearby units.  Alerted units have higher listen range, move slightly faster, dilly dally slightly less time, and generally look around a lot more.
Add a new 'ai move' type -- walking.  When this is on, they are walking towards a target point.  Use A* to find a path there, and then follow it.

Add a bit of a random offset to bullets so they don't look like perfect laser-accuracy shots.

Entry portals -- spots for your units to teleport in to the map at.
Make it so that player units don't exist on the map until they 'port' in.
Exit Portal(s) -- places to get to for victory.

Way to tell what player units are available from the map definition.
A way to switch units without setting the 'go back in time' thing.
Make units die right when they shoot, as opposed to after the animation is over.
When the enemy units see a corpse, they should investigate.
When the enemy loses sight of you, it should go to where you were to investigate.

When changing the currently selected unit, make it smarter about it. (skip dead or finished units, make it easier to switch units on the fly.)
Units shouldn't trigger the 'set spawn' unless they walk into the tile.

A way to change levels.

A parameter for patrol points to have alternate destinations.
A parameter for patrol points to indicate how long units should search there.
A parameter for patrol points to indicate what direction(s) units should search in while they are there.
Random numbers need to be eliminated.
When you hold space bar, show the radius around you that you can hit in.
While I'm at it, the swordsman has a silly amount of range...

Make it so that enemies can't attack a target unless they're facing it (so you can sneak up on them)
		May have to increase turn rate when alerted to make up for this.
		
Level Editor		
	- a "Test Level" button.
	- Safer saving -- When saving create a temporary file rather than just overwriting the old file.  When save is complete, then erase the old file.
	- Increase the resolution so that you have a bit more space to do stuff in.  Use the extra space as a HUD
	- When loading a file that doesn't exist, create the file.
		
Traps
	-Base Implemented
	-Traps that start on impassable squares should activate right away.
	- A way to change the tileset in the level editor.
		-Change representation of tiles in the file.  Use 1-3-2 to mean tileset-tile-variabilityNumber
	Spear trap (Spears out of a wall damaging all units in its path)
	Spike Trap (Spikes shoot out of the ground.  If a unit is on the square when it triggers, they take damage)
	Doors that can be opened with buttons
	Enemies can currently 'see through' doors.  Update the 'Terrain.CanSeeThrough' to check traps.
	A way to add parameters to these traps.
	Secret Door
	Keys and doors locked with keys.
		(Items that can be picked up and held.  Each unit can hold one item.)
Switches
	Step on it
	
Scrolling camera

Support different tilesets
Support a "Noise" tile.  Basically draw the tile, then add one of that specific tile's random noise options.  The noise should be in the second dimension of the tileset.
Progress bar on loading level

Make pressure plates in 4th level more obvious
Reduce cooldown on weapon
Make cooldown more obvious
Make it more obvious when spikes are dangerous
Need a way to re-enter the teleportation circles.
